# FoodTrucks

## How To Run 
Start the program by hitting the play button in the top bar. From there, the user will be prompted immediately to start entering names for the trucks

## Project Description
This program is built for a user to add 3 fields of a name, food type, and a rating for food trucks and add them to an array that is no longer than 5 in length. The user is also able to quit which will then take them to a menu in which they can choose 4 options

## Technologies Used
In this program, I used 2 while loops while also using a sequence of nested if statements, followed by calling to public methods when the user chooses one of the 4 options

## Lessons Learned
For this program, it is easy to get overwhelmed right off the bat, so I think just keeping in mind how to break the project down piece by piece is the easiest approach
